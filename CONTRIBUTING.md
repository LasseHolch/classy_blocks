You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

    troubleshooting.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\"
and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
\"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to
implement it.

### Write Documentation

classy_blocks could always use more documentation, whether as part of
the official classy_blocks docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in
blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [Github Issues](https://github.com/FranzBangar/classy_blocks/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to
    implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
    contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here\'s how to set up `classy_blocks` for local development.

1.  Fork the `classy_blocks` repo on GitHub

2.  Clone your fork locally:
    ``` shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/classy_blocks.git
    ```

3.  Create a branch for local development:
    ``` shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```
    Now you can make your changes locally.

4.  Prepare and activate virtual environment, update pip:
    ``` shell
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ "venv/bin/activate"
    $ python -m pip install -U pip
    ```

5. Install required dependencies (based on what you want to
contribute). - Small fixes like documentation, typo or similar: no need
to install anything. Do your change and submit PR.
Code/test/examples fixes: install local `classy_block` package and development requirements:
    ``` shell
    $ python -m pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

6.  Install `pre-commit` hook by [official docs](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts).
    ``` shell
    $ pre-commit install
    ```

7.  If code changes were made: check that your changes pass tests, typing,
formatting and other rules.
    ``` shell
    $ python -m pytest
    $ ruff check --fix src tests
    $ mypy src tests
    ```
    Make sure you test on all python versions. Help yourself with `tox` configurations.

1.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ``` shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

2.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
    The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8. Check results of
    GitHub actions and make sure that nothing was broken.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in [README.md]("https://github.com/damogranlabs/classy_blocks/blob/master/README.md")
    and/or [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/damogranlabs/classy_blocks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Uploading To PyPi
Just follow the official documentation:
- [Generate distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)
- [Upload to PyPi](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives)

## Tips

* To run a subset of tests:
``` shell
$ python -m pytest -k TestGrading
```
Follow official `pytest` documentation: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/how-to/usage.html#usage
* `tox` is not installed by default, as it is only dependency of GitHub Actions.
Install it manually if required.
